For the holidays, Professor Mehlhase decided to rent a Porsche to visit with family members.
During the visit, they attended a Rammstein concert and afterwards all visited the local Biergarten.
At the local Biergarten, Professor Mehlhase bought some Bratwurst sandwiches for herself and each of her family members.
Everyone loved the Brot, especially her Hund.
Her hund quickly finshed the bratwurst and resumed chewing on the Professor's fancy Dirndel much to her dismay.
After the mishap with the hund, the team decided to head to the local Ratskeller to laugh it all off.
The Ratskeller had a special deal on fresh gebaeck and Apfelkuche from the local Backerei.
